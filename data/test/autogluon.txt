The algorithm that beats 99% of Data Scientists with 4 lines of code.Cristian Leo·FollowPublished inTowards Data Science·19 min read·Jul 3, 2024--3ShareImage generated by DALL-EIn two popular Kaggle competitions, AutoGluon beat 99% of the participating data scientists after merely 4h of training on the raw data (AutoGluon Team. “AutoGluon: AutoML for Text, Image, and Tabular Data.” 2020)This statement, taken from the AutoGluon research paper, perfectly captures what we will explore today: a machine-learning framework that delivers impressive performance with minimal coding. You only need four lines of code to set up a complete ML pipeline, a task that could otherwise take hours. Yes, just four lines of code! See for yourself:from autogluon.tabular import TabularDataset, TabularPredictortrain_data = TabularDataset('train.csv')predictor = TabularPredictor(label='Target').fit(train_data, presets='best_quality')predictions = predictor.predict(train_data)These four lines handle data preprocessing by automatically recognizing the data type of each column, feature engineering by finding useful column combinations, and model training through ensembling to identify the best-performing model within a given…----3FollowWritten by Cristian Leo32K Followers·Writer for Towards Data ScienceA Data Scientist with a passion about recreating all the popular machine learning algorithm from scratch.FollowHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams
